        <h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
        <p><strong>Sprint 1: Getting Started, Object-Oriented Programming Concepts, and Tools of the Trade</strong></p>
        <br>

        <p><strong>Welcome to Object-Oriented Programming!</strong> By this point in your programming journey I'm sure
        that you are confident in writing basic software programs. You've learned about structured programming
        techniques like sequence, selection, and repetition. You've learned how to break complicated programs down into
        more manageable pieces by using functions. That's great, but to create modern programs you need to master some
        additional skills. These additional skills are what object-oriented programming give us.</p>

        <p>You have likely noticed that I use the term “sprint 1” to describe our first set of course activities and
        assignments. Sprints are part of the Scrum development process. The term is used to describe a unit of work
        which will be delivered in a given amount of time. We will be learning more about sprints and Scrum in the
        coming days. For now it is sufficient to know that our sprint 1 activies listed below are expected to take 8 to
        12 hours of focused effort to complete.</p>

        <p>Let's start with what we hope to learn in sprint 1. By the end of sprint 1 we will be able to:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>Identify and understand key object-oriented programming concepts and practices</li>
            <li>Access course material utilizing Blackboard and the GitHub</li>
            <li>Utilize command line and graphical tools to navigate our computer operating system and local file
            system</li>
            <li>Create, edit, and update source code in a text editor</li>
            <li>Compile and execute basic Java applications utilizing Java command line tools</li>
            <li>Manage source code utilizing the GitHub and the Git command line client</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Below is our sprint 1 activities list. Although you are welcome to pursue the activities in any order, they
        are listed in the order I think will be the most beneficial for you to work through the topics. Each item is
        expected to take 20 to 40 minutes of focused time unless otherwise noted.</p>

            <li>Complete the Java “Hello World” tutorial. As in all tutorials, you should follow along and complete the
            steps yourself. As you go through the tutorial, you should make the resulting application uniquely your own
            by adding standard comments at the top application (i.e. your name, class, etc.), changing the names of
            variables, adding small features, etc. Finally, be sure to save your unique creation as I will often be
            asking you to submit it as part of your programming assignment.

        caught up.</p>
