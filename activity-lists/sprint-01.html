        <h1>Object Oriented Programming</h1>
        <h2>Sprint 1: Getting Started, &amp; Tools of the Trade, and Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts</h2>
        <p><strong>Welcome to Object-Oriented Programming!</strong> By this point in your software development journey,
        I'm sure that you have confidence in writing basic software programs. You've learned about structured
        programming techniques like sequence, selection, and repetition. You've learned how to break complicated
        programs down into more manageable pieces by using functions. That's great, but to create modern programs you
        need to master some additional skills and concepts. These additional skills and concepts are what
        object-oriented programming give us.</p>

        <p>You will notice that I often use the term “sprint 1” to describe our first set of course material and
        activities. The sprint term is comes from Scrum development process. For now, it's enough to know that“sprints”
        are part of Scrum which is the most popular Agile development process, and that our sprint 1 activities are
        expected to take 8 to 12 hours of effort to complete.</p>

        <p>Let's start with what we hope to learn in sprint 1. By the end of sprint 1 we will be able to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access course material utilizing Blackboard and the GitHub</li>
            <li>Utilize command line and graphical tools to navigate our computer operating system and local file
            system</li>
            <li>Create, edit, and update source code in a text editor</li>
            <li>Compile and execute basic Java applications utilizing Java command line tools</li>
            <li>Manage and submit source code utilizing the GitHub and the Git command line client</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Below is our sprint 1 activities list. Although you are welcome to pursue the activities in any order you 
            prefer, I am listing them in the order I think will be the most beneficial for you to work through the 
            topics. The anticipated time commitment for each item is 20 to 40 minutes of focused time unless otherwise
            noted.</p>
