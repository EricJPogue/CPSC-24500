# Object Oriented Programming
## Sprint 1: Getting Started
**Welcome to Object-Oriented Programming!** By this point in your software development journey, I'm sure that you have
confidence in writing basic software programs. You've learned about structured programming techniques like sequence, 
selection, and repetition. You've learned how to break complicated programs down into more manageable pieces by using 
functions. That's great, but to create modern programs you need to master some additional skills and concepts. These 
additional skills and concepts are what object-oriented programming give us.

You will notice that I am using the term "sprint 1" to describe our first set of course material and activies. The 
sprint term is comes from Scrum development process. For now, it's enough to know that "sprints" are part of Scrum which 
is the most popular Agile development process, and that our sprint 1 activies are expected to take 7 to 10 hours of 
effort to complete. 

Let's start with what we hope to learn in sprint 1. By the end of sprint 1 we will be able to:
- Access course material utilizing Blackboard and the GitHub cloud service
- Utilize graphical and command line tools to navigate your computer OS and local file system
- Create, edit, and update source code in a text editor
- Compile and execute basic Java applications utilizing Java command line tools 
- Manage and submit source code utilizing the GitHub cloud service and the Git command line client

Below is our sprint 1 activities list. Although you are welcome to pursue the activities in any order you prefer, they 
are listed them in the order I think will be the most beneficial for you to work through the topics. The anticipated 
time commitment for each item is 20 to 40 minutes unless otherwise noted.
