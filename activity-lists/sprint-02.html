        <h2>Sprint 2: Patterns, Principles, and Java Programming </h2>

        <p><strong>Welcome to sprint 2.</strong> We covered a lot of material in sprint 1. However, we didn't get a
        chance to write much code. This sprint get your Java compilers out. We are going to start practicing some of the
        concepts we learned. Note that sprint 2 and all subsequent sprints are approximately twice as long as sprint 1
        and are expected to take 18 to 22 hours of effort to complete.</p>

        <p>Below is the list of activities that we will need to complete this sprint. Once again you are welcome to
        pursue the activities in any order you prefer. However, I am listing them in the order I think will be the most
        beneficial for you to work through the topics. The time commitment for each line item is generally 20 to 40
        minutes unless otherwise noted.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Review Programming Assignment 2, Quiz 2, and Discussion Board 2</li>
            <li>Complete “Object-Oriented Programming Patterns”
                <a href="http://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/patterns.mp4">[video]</a>
                <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/patterns-slides-only.pptx">
                [slides]</a></li>
            <li>Analyze and commit to adopting the “How to Be a Success Programmer” suggestions that you feel are the
            most important 
                <a href="https://cpsc-24500.azurewebsites.net/successful-programmer.html">[link]</a></li>
            <li>Sign up for Safari Books Online which is available to you free through Lewis University
                <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/temporary-access/">[link]</a></li>
            <li>Within Safari Books Online execute searches for Object-Oriented Programming, OOP, Git, GitHub, and Java
            and review the results of each search</li>
            <li>Review the answers to Quiz 1. Many of the same topics will come up in future so it is important that you
            understand the concepts question.</li>               
            <li>Complete the Java “Hello World” tutorial. As in <strong>all</strong> programming exercises, you should
            follow along and complete the steps yourself. As you go through the lab, you should make the resulting
            application uniquely you own by adding standard comments at the top application (i.e. your name, class,
            etc.), changing the names of variables, adding small features, etc. Finally, be sure to keep your unique
            creation as I will often be asking you to submit it as part of your programming assignment.

                target="_blank">[video]</a></li>
            <li>Complete the Java "Shapes Step 1" tutorial. Once again as will all labs, be sure to follow along and
            complete the steps yourself, to make the resulting application uniquely your own, and to be ready to submit
            your version of the application as part of an Assignment.

                target="_blank">[video]</a></li> 
            <li>Complete the Java "Shapes Step 2" tutorial. Once again, be sure to follow along and complete the steps
            yourself, to make the resulting application uniquely your own, and to be ready to submit your version of the
            application as part of an Assignment.

                target="_blank">[video]</a></li>
            <li>Complete &quot;Object-Oriented Programming Principles&quot;
                <a href="http://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/principles.mp4">[video]</a>

            <li>Read and Understand the article “What is JSON? JavaScript Object Notation explained” 
                 <a
                 href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3222851/javascript/what-is-json-javascript-object-notation-explained.html"

            <li>Read and Understand “JSON Introduction” from W3C 
                 <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp" target="_blank">[link]</a></li> 
            <li>If you do not already have access to a current version of Microsoft Office, install the current
            Microsoft PowerPoint (PowerPoint Mobile) and Word (Word Mobile) viewers
            <a

        </ol> 

        <p>Once again, be sure to take some time and reward yourself for your efforts. Get a coffee and spend some time
        reflecting on what you've accomplished. It is important to take a little time to enjoy the moment. </p>
