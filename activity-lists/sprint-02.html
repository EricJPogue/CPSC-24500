        <h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
        <p><strong>Sprint 2: Patterns, Principles, and Java Programming</strong></p>
        <br>

        <p><strong>Welcome to sprint 2.</strong> We covered a lot of material in sprint 1. However, we didn't get a
        chance to write much code. This sprint get your Java compilers out. We are going to start practicing some of the
        concepts we learned. Note that sprint 2 and all subsequent sprints are approximately twice as long as sprint 1
        and are expected to take approximately 20 hours of focused effort to complete.</p>

        <p>By the end of sprint 2 we will be able to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify, define, and discuss OOP Principles</li>
            <li>Create, modify, compile, and execute OOP based Java applications</li>
            <li>Manage and submit source code utilizing the GitHub and the Git command line client</li>
            <li>Utilize JSON to represent program data</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Below is the list of activities that we will need to complete this sprint. Once again you are welcome to
        pursue the activities in any order you prefer. However, they are listed in the order I think will be the most
        beneficial for you to work through the topics. The time commitment for each line item is generally 20 to 40
        minutes unless otherwise noted.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Review Programming Assignment 2, Quiz 2, and Discussion Board 2</li>
            <li>Analyze and commit to adopting the “How to Be a Success Programmer” suggestions that you feel are the
            most important
