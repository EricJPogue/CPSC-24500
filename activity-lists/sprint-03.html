        <p><strong>Sprint 3: Graphical User Interfaces and FaceDraw</strong></p>
        <br>

        <p><b><i>Welcome to Sprint 3.</i></b> We have covered a lot in the first two sprints. Much of it was preparing
        us for our first substantial programming assignment. I believe we are ready to apply what we have learned to our
        FaceDraw project. Be sure to get an early start on the project and stay focused. You will note that there are
        fewer items on our activities list this week. That is because you will need to focus your time and energy on
        FaceDraw.</p>
        <p>By the end of this sprint we will be able to:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>Develop a moderately sophisticated graphical Java application (FaceDraw)</li>
            <li>Comfortably utilize our Java development environment</li>
            <li>Utilize source code management and Git/GitHub</li>
            <li>Effectively compile, debug, submit, update, and manage Java application source code</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As you would expect, our activities list for this sprint (below) is laser focused on helping us achieve the
        above Learning Objectives. Once again I have attempted to list this items in the order that I think will be most
        beneficial for you to complete them.</p> 
        <ol>
            <li>Review and start working on Programming Assignment 3 - FaceDraw and Quiz 3</li>
            <li>Complete "Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) in Java" lesson 
                <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/java-gui-programming.mp4"
                target="_blank">[video]</a></li>
            <li>Review the answers from Quiz 2</li>
            <li>Take one last look at "How to Be a Success Programmer" suggestions and intentionally decide if there is
            something you are going to change now that the programming assignments are becoming more challenging. 
                <a href="https://cpsc-24500.azurewebsites.net/successful-programmer.html" target="_blank">[link]</a></li>         
            <li>Complete the FaceDrawLite tutorial
                <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/java-facedraw-lite.mp4"
                target="_blank">[video]</a> ~2 hours</li>
            <li>Complete your initial Discussion Board (DB) post by the middle of the sprint</li>
            <li>FaceDraw, FaceDraw, FaceDraw ~8 to 12 hours</li>
        </ol> 

        <p>Take a few minutes to reflect on how much you have learned by completing the FaceDraw project. It's likely a
        significant step up from anything you have programmed in the past. Well done.</p>

        <p>Feel free to post a note in our Class Forum or to send me an email you have questions.</p>
