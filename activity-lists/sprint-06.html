        <h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
        <p><strong>Sprint 6: Multithreading and Application Programming Interfaces</strong></p>
        <br>

        <p><b><i>Sprint 6!</i></b> This sprint offers a mix of the old and the new. Some things like hosting JSON
            files on our Azure websites and enhancing our SwissArmyKnife application will be additions to what we have already 
            learned. On the other hand, learning how to write multi-threaded Java applications will likely prove to be 
            challenging.</p>
            <p>By the end of this sprint we will be able to:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:square">
                <li>Develop our first multi-threaded Java application</li>
                <li>Create a web service by hosting JSON files on our MS Azure websites</li>
                <li>Enhance intermediate command line Java applications that span multiple Java files</li>
                <li>Create an automated (api level) Java test client
            </ul>
        <p>You will notice this sprint that it looks like our activities list is shrinking. Don't let that fool you. At this 
            point in the class many of our activities are naturally migrating from our activities list to our assignments. 
            This is because you are becoming more capable of researching and figuring out how to implement new features. </p>
        <p>Our activities list for this sprint includes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b><i>Review Discussion Board 6, Programming Assignment 6 and Quiz 6.</i></b> Note that our DB, PA, and 
                Quiz are tightly integrate this sprint.</li>
            <li>Lab: Complete "Website Creation With GitHub and Microsoft Azure" Tutorial 
                    <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/environment-configuration/github-deployment-to-azure.mp4" 
                    target="_blank">[video]</a></li>
            <li>Lab: Complete "Personal Information JSON Files" Tutorial

                    target="_blank">[video]</a></li>
            <li>Create and/or update your JSON files and upload them to your MS Azure website. This is described in more detail in 
                Quiz 6. ~1.5 hours
            <li><b><i>Implement the enhancements to your Azure website and SwissArmyKnife application that are described in 
                Assignment 6.</i></b> This is a lot of work. Don't wait to get started! And be sure to turn something in even 
                if you are not able to complete all items. ~8 to 12 hours </li>
            <li><b><i>**Complete your DB6 by Thursday, February 21st.</i></b> This includes posting the URLs of your JSON files. You will 
                need to watch your DB6 thread as others will test your JSON files and report defects in your DB thread. </li>
            <li>Review "Performance and Multithreading" 
                <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/performance-and-multithreaded-programming.mp4" 
                target="_blank">[video]</a></li>

            <li>Respond to DB6 by reviewing and commenting on your classmates' JSON files via their DB posts.</li>
            <li>Optionally review Object-Oriented Programming Languages and Platforms that you viewed last sprint
                <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/languages-and-platforms.mp4" 
                target="_blank">[video]</a></li>
            <li><b><i>Submit all remaining assignments including Programming Assignment 6, Quiz 6, and responding to one 
                of your classmate's **Discussion Board posts by Sunday, February 24th at 11:59pm</i></b></li>
            <li>Be sure to treat yourself well throughout the week!</li>
