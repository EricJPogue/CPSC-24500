        <p><b><i>Sprint 7!</i></b> How time flies. Sprint 7 is a shortened sprint and ends on <b><i><u>Sunday, April 21st</u></i></b> at 11:59pm. No late 
            assignments will be accepted as we need to be dedicated to making sure that we have the maximum time to work on our 
            final projects. </p>
        <p>By the end of this sprint we will be able to:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>Develop and enhance intermediate level graphical, distributed, multithreaded Java applications</li>
            <li>Create View and Model classes that conform to the model-view-controller pattern</li>
            <li>Begin to understand Application Architecture and its relationship to Object-Oriented Programming</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This sprint's activities list is shorter and easier than previous sprints. This should make up for the shortened 
                sprint and give you time to complete your final project proposal.</p> 
        <p>Our activities list for this week includes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b><i>Review Programming Assignment (PA) 7, Quiz 7, and Discuss Board (DB) 7.</i></b></li>
            <li>Continue to work on your final project proposal. You may want to start working on elements of your final project 
                in order to make sure that you are comfortable with your proposed direction and features.</li>
            <li>Lab: Complete the <b><i>ThunderbirdLite</i></b> tutorial
                <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/java-thunderbird-lite.mp4" 
                target="_blank">[video]</a>. The ThunderbirdLite source code is available to you in your "source-lite" folder
                and <u>can be reused/submitted as part of your Thunderbird programming assignment.</u> ~2 hours
            <li>Complete Programming Assignment (PA) 7. ~6 hours</li>
            <li>Continue to monitor and update your DB6 thread from last sprint and fix/update your JSON contact files as 
                necessary. If you are having difficulties in hosting your JSON files in Microsoft Azure, email me ASAP 
                so that we can make sure that you are up and running.</li>
            <li><b><i>Submit your initial DB7 post by Thursday, April February 18th at 11:59pm</i></b></li>
            <li>Complete "Application Architectures, Object-Oriented Programming, and Databases - Part 1"
                <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/application-architecture-part1.mp4" 
                target="_blank">[video]</a>
            <li>Start working on your Final Project</li>
            <li><b><i>Submit all remaining assignments including Programming Assignment 7, Quiz 7, and responding to one 
                of your classmate's Discussion Board posts by <u>Sunday, April 21st at 11:59pm</u></i></b></li>
            <li>Be sure to treat yourself well again this sprint!</li>
