        <h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
        <p><em>Sprint 7: Model-View-Controller and Application Architecture</em></p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Welcome to sprint 7.</em> How time flies. We have two separate programming assignment this sprint. In the
        first assignment (PA7) is Thunderbird. We will be completing the Thunderbird application by the middle of the
        sprint. Thunderbird is also different than previous assignments in that we will be enhancing an existing
        application rather than creating a new application from scratch. This is more like what you could expect in a
        professional programming environment. I think you will enjoy it.</p>
        As mentioned previously, we will be submitting the Thunderbird assignment at the halfway point of the sprint.
        This is so that we can focus entirely on our course final projects for the second half of sprint 7 as well as
        the entirety sprint 8.</p>
        <p>By the end of this sprint we will be able to:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>Develop and enhance intermediate level graphical, distributed, multi-threaded Java applications</li>
            <li>Create View and Model classes that conform to the model-view-controller pattern</li>
            <li>Begin to understand Application Architecture and its relationship to Object-Oriented Programming</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our activities list for this sprint includes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><em>Review Programming Assignment (PA) 7 Thunderbird, Programming Assignment 7b Final Project, Quiz 7, 
                and Discuss Board (DB) 7</em></li>
            <li>Complete the ThunderbirdLite tutorial
                <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/java-thunderbird-lite.mp4"
                target="_blank">[video]</a> using the ThunderbirdLite source code from our "Examples" repository as needed</li>


            <li>Once you have completed the ThunderbirdList tutorial, pull the code from the Thunderbird repository by executing the command "git clone https://github.com/EricJPogueCourses/Thunderbird.git"  
                and <u>can be reused/submitted as part of your Thunderbird programming assignment.</u> ~2 hours
            <li style="color:red"><em>Complete Programming Assignment (PA) 7 Thunderbird by the middle of the sprint ~6 hours:<em></li>

            <li>Continue to monitor and update your DB6 thread from last sprint and fix/update your JSON contact files
            as necessary. If you are having difficulties in hosting your JSON files in Microsoft Azure, email me ASAP so
            that we can make sure that you are up and running.</li>
            <li>Complete "Application Architectures, Object-Oriented Programming, and Databases - Part 1"
