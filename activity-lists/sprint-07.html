        <p><strong>Sprint 7: Model-View-Controller and Application Architecture</strong></p>
        <br>

        <p><em>Sprint 7!</em>How time flies. We will need to watch our time carefully in sprint 7. Sprint 7 officially ends on 
            Sunday, December 1st at 11:59pm. Since many of you will be returning from Thanksgiving break on Sunday, I am giving 
            you until noon on Monday to submit your sprint 7 assignments. However, since we need to be immediately focused on 
            sprint 8 and our final projects, no sprint 7 assignments will be accepted after the Monday noon deadline.</p>
        <p>By the end of this sprint we will be able to:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>Develop and enhance intermediate level graphical, distributed, multithreaded Java applications</li>
            <li>Create View and Model classes that conform to the model-view-controller pattern</li>
            <li>Begin to understand Application Architecture and its relationship to Object-Oriented Programming</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our activities list for this sprint includes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><em>Review Programming Assignment (PA) 7, Quiz 7, and Discuss Board (DB) 7</em></li>
            <li>Lab: Complete the <em>ThunderbirdLite</em> tutorial

                target="_blank">[video]</a>. The ThunderbirdLite source code is available to you in your "source-lite" folder
                and <u>can be reused/submitted as part of your Thunderbird programming assignment.</u> ~2 hours
            <li>Complete Programming Assignment (PA) 7 which includes complete v1 of your final project. ~10 hours</li>
            <li>Consider updating your final project proposal if necessary</li>
            <li>Continue to monitor and update your DB6 thread from last sprint and fix/update your JSON contact files as 
                necessary. If you are having difficulties in hosting your JSON files in Microsoft Azure, email me ASAP 
                so that we can make sure that you are up and running.</li>
