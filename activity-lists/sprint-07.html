        <h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
        <p><em>Sprint 7: Model-View-Controller and Application Architecture</em></p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Welcome to sprint 7.</em> How time flies. We have two separate programming assignment this sprint. The
        first assignment (PA7) is Thunderbird. We will be completing the Thunderbird application by the middle of the
        sprint. Thunderbird is also different than previous assignments in that we will be enhancing an existing
        application rather than creating a new application from scratch. This is more like what you could expect in an
        entry level professional programming position. I think you will enjoy it.</p>
        The second half of the sprint will be entirely focused on completing version 1 of your final project. 
        which will be submitted by the end of the sprint in programming assignment 7b.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
