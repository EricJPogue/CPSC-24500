        <p><strong>Sprint 7: Model-View-Controller and Application Architecture</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Sprint 7!</em>How time flies. We will need to watch our time carefully in sprint 7. Sprint 7 officially ends on 
            Sunday, December 1st at 11:59pm. Since many of you will be returning from Thanksgiving break on Sunday, I am giving 
            you until noon on Monday to submit your sprint 7 assignments. However, since we need to be immediately focused on 
            sprint 8 and our final projects, no sprint 7 assignments will be accepted after the Monday noon deadline.</p>
        <p>By the end of this sprint we will be able to:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>Develop and enhance intermediate level graphical, distributed, multithreaded Java applications</li>
            <li>Create View and Model classes that conform to the model-view-controller pattern</li>
            <li>Begin to understand Application Architecture and its relationship to Object-Oriented Programming</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our activities list for this sprint includes:</p>
