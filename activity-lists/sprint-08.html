        <p><strong>Sprint 8: Final Projects and Databases</strong></p>
        <br>

        <p><b><i>Sprint 8! Need I say more.</i></b></p>
        <p>With one week left, let's finish strong. I challenge you to make your final project something that makes you proud. Not
            because it will get you a good grade (which it likely will), but because you find it useful or elegant or beautiful.</p>
        <p>By the end of this sprint we will be able to:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li><b><i>Independently</i></b> design, develop, and enhance intermediate level graphical Java applications using 
                Object-Oriented Programming Concepts, Patterns, and Principles</li>
            <li>Understand Application Architecture and its relationship to Object-Oriented Programming</li>
            <li>Understand how relational database do (and don't) support Object-Oriented Programming</li>

        </ul>
        <p>In order to do my part if giving you time to build something exceptional, I am removing all non-essential items
        this week's Activities List. As such, our list includes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b><i>Final Project, Final Project, and more Final Project.</i></b></li>
            <li>Review DB8... you do not need to post anything this sprint.</li>
            <li>Complete "Application Architectures, Object-Oriented Programming, and Databases - Part 2"
                    <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/application-architecture-part2.mp4" 
                    target="_blank">[video]</a> 
            <li><b><i>Complete your Final Project (PA8) and Quiz 8 by Sunday, May 5th by 11:59pm. Note your Final Project (PA8) 
                must be submitted at least 2 hours before yo are scheduled to present your project if you are presenting your final 
                project early.</i></b></li>
            <li>Definitely do something extra special for yourself and for those that have supported you during this course.
                A dinner and a night out for yourself and your significant other would seem to be in order if you ask me.</li>
        </ol> 
        <p>Feel free to post something in our "Class Forum" discussion board forum if you have any questions.</p>  
        <p>Good luck!</p>
